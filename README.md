# QSWAP-SC-ALLOCATION-RESTRUCTURE
Restructure the trading fee allocation system. 

QSWAP Restructure Proposal

QSWAP shareholders aim to restructure of the current distribution model of the trading fees to a more fair business model.

The QSWAP SC was developed by the Dev team headed by (discord name) PeterD but was later abandoned soon after the IPO. PETERD decided NOT to build the business to run an LP DEX on top of this smart contract.  He has stated a couple times that he will forfeit the Dev allocation of 20% to the community. He has also not done any further development or indicated his intent to since soon after the IPO.

Proof of giving to community see here.

“Since the team fundamentally disagrees with our view that the current SC reward mechanism clashes with basic business common sense, we’ve decided to hand the project and the remaining 20% dividend share back to the community.” PeterD

The QSWAP shareholders have decided to develop the business themselves and lead by a 5 member team (made up of SC holders) has initiated a restructure.

Business team decided to add 3 (QX portion, Investment & Rewards Fund, and Burn) as ADDITIONAL allocations of the trading fees.
